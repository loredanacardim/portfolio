        <p class="apresentacao__conteudo__texto"> Hi there! My name is Loredana Cardim, and I'm a front-end developer with a passion for creating beautiful, user-friendly websites and applications. In addition, I'm currently a student of Electrical Engineering, with a focus on high voltage electrical networks. I'm interested in specializing in this area to gain a deeper understanding of the technical aspects of building and managing complex electrical systems.

          When I'm not coding, you can usually find me with my nose buried in a good book or tending to my plant collection. I'm also a big fan of binge-watching TV series in my downtime.

          <p class="apresentacao__conteudo__texto">
          While I haven't yet had the opportunity to work professionally in the field of programming, I've been working on personal projects to develop my skills, and you can find some of these projects on my portfolio page. I like to enjoy the challenge of finding creative solutions to problems and delivering high-quality work on time and on budget.
